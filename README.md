# TTN MAPPER-TRACKER

### Based on the code from [xoseperez/ttgo-beam-tracker](https://github.com/xoseperez/ttgo-beam-tracker), with excerpts from [dermatthias/Lora-TTNMapper-T-Beam](https://github.com/dermatthias/Lora-TTNMapper-T-Beam) to fix an issue with incorrect GPS data being transmitted to The Things Network. I aslo added support for the US 915 MHz frequency, which is now enabled by default but can easily be changed.

This is a LoRaWAN node based on the [TTGO T-Beam](https://github.com/LilyGO/TTGO-T-Beam) development platform.
It uses a RFM95 by HopeRF and the MCCI LoRaWAN LMIC stack.
The sample code is configured to connect to The Things Network using EU frequency, but you can easily change that.
